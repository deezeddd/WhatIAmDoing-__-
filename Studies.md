### Related to .net/java/nodejs 

  - **.Net**
      - We primarily use .Net to make **Windows** applications.
      - Can also be used to make web apps ( Which I'm primarily working on! )
      - Console Apps for Windows are made using this.
          - What's the need for the Console App?
              - It is used for its simplicity. Why make a whole GUI just for a simple task, right?
              - It is lightweight, text i/o operations can be performed easily
              - Easily deployable over the cloud.
      - Generally considered to have strong security features, especially for enterprise applications.
      - Many packages are pre-made and built in to ship things faster.
      - It has a stronger focus on the **Windows** environment.
      - It often performs better in the **Windows** environment due to optimizations in the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and better garbage collection.
      - OOPS and strongly typed language with various inbuilt classes and features.
      - .Net core has been built for multi-platform applications
      - Supports multi-threading
              

  - **Java**
      - Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle
      - Java is an object-oriented language, which promotes cleaner and more modular code
      - Java applications can run on any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
      - Historically, Java has faced security vulnerabilities, particularly related to its runtime environment.
      - Java includes automatic garbage collection, which helps manage memory allocation and deallocation.
      - Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify development for various applications, including web, mobile, and enterprise solutions.
      - Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to create applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
      - This is particularly advantageous if you want to maintain a single codebase for multiple platforms, cz it uses JVM to run Java code.

 - C# vs Java
   - Java is designed to be platform-independent, allowing applications to run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   - Java is the primary language for Android app development, making it essential for developers targeting the mobile market.
   - Both are mature languages, thus preferred for long-term projects
   - C# is generally used for the Windows apps more.
   - Java and C# have very similar syntax as they are both part of the C-family of programming languages.
   - C# is generally considered faster than Java, especially for memory-intensive tasks, due to its more efficient garbage collector


  - Node
      - Used for more I/O intensive tasks
          - I/O? operations which require more waiting from External resources, like databases, another API etc.
          - Ex: CRUD on dB, file operations, API Calls, Media Streaming from external sources.
      - But you need to think of ways which speed up the I/O processes to make the application faster.
